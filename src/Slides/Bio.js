                <p className="biop">I am Sjaan (pronounced sh-aa-n), a recent Portland transplant who moved almost 3,000 to pursue web design and development. I have a strong background in sales and design with a proven track record of success holding leadership roles within small groups, most recently by maintaining a top 10 rank in a district of 60+ employees. I decided to transition out of sales and into web design in order professionally express my creative side while utilizing my analytical skills. I thrive in small teams working to solve complex problems and create beautiful products. I'm looking to connect with companies who are focused on cultivating diverse teams and producing gorgeous work.</p>
